In this page you´ll find the project of a secondary studient.</br>
I really don´t know why a project based practically in a "Netflix" serie</br>
but the only think I can (and have) to do is to make my project until </br>
I want to fail the year. So well... Besides you´ll see the project, you´ll</br>
find a phillosophical way to interpret the Black Mirror´s chapter: Play test</br>
and an adolescent´s point of view about technology, how we control the </br>
technology and it´s advances (or how it control us). Well... Let´s begin.
</p>
<hr/> 
<h2>Should we have an opinion, a belief or knowledge about limits of technology? Why?</h2> 
<img src="index.jpg">
<p>
An opnion...? Yes. A belief...? I really don´t think so. A knowledge about </br>
it´s limits? I think that it´s something that when you buy something </br>
technological it have to be impressed in big "Caution: this have it´s</br> 
limits please read´em", because i really think that it´s cool that the big </br> 
technology companies want to sell it´s products, it´s really cool,  but isn´t</br>
cool that sell it without inform us, well... I think that, as the antigue</br>
tyrants, that thought that the ignorance of their people won´t make that </br>
reveal in the face of their dictatorship. The Big Technology Companies (as </br>
Samsung, Hawuei, Sony, Motorola, etc) don´t inform us because they fear that,</br>
if we know more about the bad things that could happen if we don´t use good </br>
our cellphones or appliances. So I think that if someone wants to buy a </br>
cellphone, tablet, or whatever technological thing to his/her children, they </br>
have to inform them and teach them how to use a cellphone, because the child</br> 
could use that in a wrong way and end up in a problem.

<h2>Do you think that technology improves or inhibits our knowledge tools and skills? Why?</h2>
<img src="Mind&Technology.jpg">
<p>
I think That technology such it improves our knowledge inhibits it. Technology</br> 
is a two phylum weapon, it can help us as can harm us. It can improves our</br>
knowledge by the way that we can learn new things, like a new language, easely</br>
and without having to go a expensive course. But if can inhibit it by the way</br>
that if the technology is used in a bad way, it can´t help us to be better and</br>
can make us fall in bad desicions and make us know, but know bad things that</br>
won´t benefit us, that would harm us and the ones we love. So I don´t think</br>
that it can completely improve our knowledge or inhibit it. I don´t see myself</br>
in position to think that technology only makes us more backward or wiser,</br>
because it does the two (well the only and unique way that it only makes one,</br> 
to damge us or to help us, is by the way youuse tchnology, for good things or</br>
for bad things).

<h2>A representing symbol for Black Mirror´s Chapter</h2>
<img src="fghj.jpg"></br>
<p>
Well, I think that technology controled the mind of the main character, first,</br>
he was always in his cellphone, even if he was in an airplane with a screen lit</br>
with a film, and later when he met a woman, he searched a work with an app in his</br>
cellphone, and chose one of video games, and (i don´t like to make spoiler to no</br>
one, so sorry if that is the case) and the end he dies because the prototype, that</br>
was being test with him, finish killing him, so thats the reason that I chose that</br>
symbol to represent the chapter of Black Mirror: Play test.
